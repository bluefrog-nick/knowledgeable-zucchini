      When you’re preparing to close a business acquisition, it’s crucial to
      work with a partner who can effectively manage the financial, operational,
      and legal diligence processes to ensure you won't lose your money buying a
      lemon. At Guardian Due Diligence, we’re dedicated to providing
      cost-effective, institutional-level quality buyside advisory and due
      diligence work with a focus on integrity. Our founder, Elliott Holland,
      was a self-funded searcher for six years prior to starting Guardian, and
      he puts that experience to work for each client.


      At Guardian Due Diligence, we support acquisition entrepreneurs looking to
      execute a business acquisition. We provide institutional-level buyside
      advisory work and can lead the full deal process or focus strictly on due
      diligence in a cost-effective manner. This allows our clients to focus on
      the deal, not the details, as we provide an expert layer of protection for
      your investment.
