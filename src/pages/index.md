          <em>"I was so wrong. I started with a 4x valuation multiple. But after
          I talked to Elliott, he pointed out customer concentration & incorrect
          add backs that took the valuation below 3x. I saved over $500k on
          purchase price. Totally worth it."</em>

          <em>"Guardian exposed certain downside scenarios that we did not
          initially uncover during our Due Diligence period. Guardian]gave us
          the confidence to walk away from the deal after months of
          negotiations. I am particularly thankful for Elliott Holland's focus
          on capital preservation, reminding our team that the best deal may be
          the one you walk away from."</em>
